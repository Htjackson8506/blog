Our second client meeting went well overall. Jacob had our schema ready to go, and the client was a big fan of everything we had done so far.
As for my role in the team, I have not been as active as I know I should be. I bit off more than I could chew for the semester overall. While my groupmates have not complained to me about it, I'm sure they wish I had contributed more overall. Everyone else is hard at work however, and I appreciate them picking up some of my slack.
Dr. Goadrich asked us if our website resized well during our presentation, which it currently does not. I plan to pick this up as my role going forward to help make up for the extra work I'm sure I've caused everyone. 
The website itself looks good, and our plan for it looks even better. I'm excited to see how things turn out.

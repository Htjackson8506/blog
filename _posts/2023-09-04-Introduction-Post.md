The majority of the setup experience in this blog was new to me. I had hardly even used github, and the instances in which I had included frequent downloads as opposed to cloning a repository. I struggled a lot with setting up ruby, as even after getting it installed it wouldn't appear on my terminal. I also started with Github desktop, since I was mildly more familiar with it, but eventually I did switch over to GitKraken.
I am still slightly confused about the following two things:
1. Why did my ruby not install properly?
2. How does the _config.yml file affect my blog?

The first of these two questions isn't really relevant, as it did work in the end, which is what matters. However, I would like to know more about what a .yml file does and how it does it.
In case it is relevant, I will include the link to the download for [Ruby][ruby-dload] that I used. I have also included a link to the [Main blog][main-blog] to return to the front page.

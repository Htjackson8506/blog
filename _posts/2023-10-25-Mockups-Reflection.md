My responsibility for the group is styling. I share this responsibility with Scott, so I'm sure there will be times when we will have to collaborate closely or risk messing up the other's work.
In our team meetings my goal was to take notes. I took note at the first client meeting, but I was unable to attend the meeting our group had later that day since I was at a conference in Detroit.
On the mockup, I created the about page. It's a little rough around the edges, but it has all the necessary information. It should also be easy to update the page to match any styling changes we settle on as a group.

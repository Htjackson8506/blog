As a group, we decided that, since the tutorial was so short, it would be easiest to work through the entire thing together. To simplify things, we worked from Jacob's computer so that all of our work was in one place and because so much of the work was on Azure's Platform.

We struggled with getting the free plan working, but Jacob was able to register for the student account in order to receive free credits. From there, we created the program, but ran into an issue with creating the resources we needed and had to restart.

After the restart, however, the tutorial was straightforward. Everything went smoothly up until we tried to show it to Dr. Goadrich in class, at which point it crashed. Luckily, however, it sorted itself out and started working without having to make any changes on our end.

It was kind of a bummer that we couldn't run the program for free, even after completing the tutorial. None of us could really find a way to fix this issue since downgrading disables the vNet, which the website needs to run. We will need to solve this before publishing the museum project, as we will not have enough credits to host it. However, I'm sure something can be worked out either on our end to fix it or the cost can be taken on by the museum.

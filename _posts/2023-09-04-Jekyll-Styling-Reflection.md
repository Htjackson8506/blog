The Jekyll Styling Lab gave me a little bit of trouble. I found it difficult to read some of the html files that I hadn't written myself. I also struggled with getting the styling to work the way I wanted to. 

I was confused by the HEAD tab that appeared in my nav bar. This was and still is not present in my local server version of the website, and I don't really know what to do about it or how it even got there in the first place. However, it does not cause any issues in my blog so I decided to leave it for now.

Here is a link to the [Dogs][dogs] page I made, as well as a link to the [HEAD][HEAD] tab that was created. 

I will also now post two pictures of dogs, since they are such magnificent creatures and it is a requirement for Step 4:

Addendum: I noticed on 9/15/23 while looking at my blog that this post did not properly upload. However, the file was still available on gitKraken and so I am pushing it from there with this message.
